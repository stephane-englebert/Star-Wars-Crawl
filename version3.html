                    <p>A long time ago...<br/></p>
                    <p>Our journey started on 5th of January 2021.</p> 
                    <p>We were young and full of hope.</p>     
                    <p>For our first battle, we're facing Git and his brother Github.</p>
                    <p>2 really strong ennemies.</p>
                    <p>We fought during a whole week and ended victourious. (well, we guess...)</p>
                    <p>Our next opponent were html and CSS.</p>
                    <p>Being a little more experienced than the first week, we had a significant advantage and won again!</p>
                    <p>We are so excited and want to discover other galaxies and universes.</p>
                    <p>On the way to the stars!!!</p>
                    <p>May the force be with you!</p>
